  # Amazon S3 [Syncer]
  #
  # Available Regions:
  #
  #  - ap-northeast-1
  #  - ap-southeast-1
  #  - eu-west-1
  #  - us-east-1
  #  - us-west-1
  #
  # Mirroring:
  #
  #  When enabled it will keep an exact mirror of your filesystem on S3. This means
  #  that when you remove a file from the filesystem, it will also remote it from S3.
  #
  # Concurrency (concurrency_type):
  #
  #  - :threads (recommended)
  #  - :processes
  #  - false
  #
  #  Threads are a good choice for such sync operations and doesn't consume any additional memory.
  #  Using :processes is discouraged as it's likely to consumes a lot of memory.
  #
  # Concurrency (concurrency_level):
  #
  #  Defaults to 2, the higher the level, the faster it will sync.
  #  If you want a high concurrency level (>2), use :threads and not :processes.
