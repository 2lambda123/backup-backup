  # Example Auth URLs
  # SoftLayer:
  #   Dallas Public Network: https://dal05.objectstorage.softlayer.net/auth/v1.0
  #   Dallas Private Network: https://dal05.objectstorage.service.networklayer.com/auth/v1.0
  #   Amsterdam Public Network: https://ams01.objectstorage.softlayer.net/auth/v1.0
  #   Amsterdam Private Network: https://ams01.objectstorage.service.networklayer.com/auth/v1.0
  #   Singapore Public Network: https://sng01.objectstorage.softlayer.net/auth/v1.0
  #   Singapore Private Network: https://sng01.objectstorage.service.networklayer.com/auth/v1.0
  #
  # Mirroring:
  #
  #   When enabled it will keep an exact mirror of your filesystem.
  #   This means that when you remove a file from the filesystem,
  #   it will also remove it from Cloud Files.
  #
  # Concurrency:
  #
  #   `concurrency_type` may be set to:
  #
  #     - false (default)
  #     - :threads
  #     - :processes
  #
  #   Set `concurrency_level` to the number of threads/processes to use.
  #   Defaults to 2.
