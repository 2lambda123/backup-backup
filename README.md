Backup 3
========

Backup is a RubyGem, written for Linux and Mac OSX, that allows you to easily perform backup operations on both your remote, as well as your local environment. It provides you with an elegant DSL in Ruby for modeling (configuring) your backups. Backup has built-in support for various databases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors and notifiers which you can mix and match. It was built with modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.

A sample Backup configuration file
==================================

This is a Backup configuration file. Check it out and read the explanation below. Backup has a [great wiki](https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/wiki) which explains each component of Backup in detail.

``` rb
Backup::Model.new(:sample_backup, 'A sample backup configuration') do

  database MySQL do |database|
    database.name               = 'my_sample_mysql_db'
    database.username           = 'my_username'
    database.password           = 'my_password'
    database.skip_tables        = ['logs']
    database.additional_options = ['--single-transaction', '--quick']
  end

  database MongoDB do |database|
    database.name             = 'my_sample_mongo_db'
    database.only_collections = ['users', 'events', 'posts']
  end

  archive :user_avatars do |archive|
    archive.add '/var/apps/my_sample_app/public/avatars'
  end

  archive :logs do |archive|
    archive.add     '/var/apps/my_sample_app/logs/production.log'
    archive.add     '/var/apps/my_sample_app/logs/newrelic_agent.log'
    archive.add     '/var/apps/my_sample_app/logs/other/'
    archive.exclude '/var/apps/my_sample_app/logs/other/exclude-this.log'
  end

  encrypt_with OpenSSL do |encryption|
    encryption.password = 'my_secret_password'
  end

  compress_with Gzip do |compression|
    compression.best = true
  end

  store_with S3 do |s3|
    s3.access_key_id      = 'my_access_key_id'
    s3.secret_access_key  = 'my_secret_access_key'
    s3.region             = 'us-east-1'
    s3.bucket             = 'my_bucket/backups'
    s3.keep               = 20
  end

  sync_with S3 do |s3|
    s3.access_key_id     = "my_access_key_id"
    s3.secret_access_key = "my_secret_access_key"
    s3.bucket            = "my-bucket"
    s3.path              = "/backups"
    s3.mirror            = true

    s3.directories do |directory|
      directory.add "/var/apps/my_app/public/videos"
      directory.add "/var/apps/my_app/public/music"
    end
  end

  notify_by Mail do |mail|
    mail.on_success = false
    mail.on_failure = true
  end

  notify_by Twitter do |tweet|
    tweet.on_success = true
    tweet.on_failure = true
  end

end
```

### Brief explanation for the above example configuration

It will dump two databases (MySQL and MongoDB), it'll create two (.t)archives (user_avatars and logs). It'll package the two database and two archives together in a single (.t)archive. It'll run the Gzip compressor to compress that archive, and then it'll run the OpenSSL encryptor to encrypt the compressed archive. Then that encrypted archive will be stored to your Amazon S3 account. If all goes well, and no exceptions are raised, you'll be notified via the Twitter notifier that the backup succeeded. If there was an exception raised during the backup process, then you'd receive an email in your inbox containing detailed exception information, as well as receive a simple Twitter message that something went wrong.

As you can see, you can freely mix and match **archives**, **databases**, **compressors**, **encryptors**, **storages** and **notifiers** for your backups. You could even specify 4 storage locations if you wanted: Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Files, Ninefold and Dropbox, it'd then store your packaged backup to 4 separate locations for high redundancy. This also applies to compressors (like Gzip, Bzip2, Lzma) and encryptors, you could double encrypt your backup with OpenSSL followed by GPG if you wanted.

Additionally we have also defined a **S3 Syncer** ( `sync_with S3` ), which does not follow the above process of archiving/compression/encryption, but instead will directly sync the whole `videos` and `music` folder structures from your machine to your Amazon S3 account. (very efficient and cost-effective since it will only transfer files that were added/changed. Additionally, since we flagged it to 'mirror', it'll also remove files from S3 that no longer exist). If you simply wanted to sync to a separate backup server that you own, you could also use the RSync syncer for even more efficient backups that only transfer the **bytes** of each file that changed.

There are more **archives**, **databases**, **compressors**, **encryptors**, **storages** and **notifiers** than displayed in the example, all available components are listed at the top of this README, as well as in the [Wiki](https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/wiki) with more detailed information.

### Running the example

Notice the `Backup::Model.new(:sample_backup, 'A sample backup configuration') do` at the top of the above example. The `:sample_backup` is called the **trigger**. This is used to identify the backup procedure/file and initialize it.

``` sh
backup perform -t [--trigger] sample_backup
```

Now it'll run the backup, it's as simple as that.

### Automatic backups

Since Backup is a simple command line utility, you should write a crontask to invoke it periodically. I recommend you use [Whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) to manage your crontab. It'll allow you to write to the crontab in pure Ruby, it provides an elegant DSL to do so, for example:

``` rb
every 6.hours do
  command "backup perform --trigger sample_backup"
end
```

With this in place, run `whenever --update-crontab backup` to write this Ruby syntax to the crontab in cron-syntax. The operating system will now invoke `backup perform --trigger sample_backup` every 6 hours. Check out the Whenever project page for more information.

Want to contribute?
-------------------

- Fork/Clone the **develop** branch
- Write RSpec tests, and test against:
  - Ruby 1.9.3-preview1
  - Ruby 1.9.2
  - Ruby 1.8.7
  - Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7
- Try to keep the overall *structure / design* of the gem the same

I can't guarantee I'll pull every pull request. Also, I may accept your pull request and drastically change parts to improve readability/maintainability. Feel free to discuss about improvements, new functionality/features in the [issue log](https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/issues) before contributing if you need/want more information.

Easily run tests against all four Ruby versions
-----------------------------------------------

Install [RVM](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) and use it to install Ruby 1.9.3, 1.9.2, 1.8.7 and REE.

    rvm get latest && rvm reload
    rvm install 1.9.3 && rvm install 1.9.2 && rvm install 1.8.7 && rvm install ree

Once these are installed, go ahead and install all the necessary dependencies.

    cd backup
    rvm use 1.9.3 && gem install bundler && bundle install
    rvm use 1.9.2 && gem install bundler && bundle install
    rvm use 1.8.7 && gem install bundler && bundle install
    rvm use ree   && gem install bundler && bundle install

The Backup gem uses [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) along with [Guard::RSpec](https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec) to quickly and easily test Backup's code against all four Rubies. If you've done the above, all you have to do is run:

    bundle exec guard

from Backup's root and that's it. It'll now test against all four Rubies each time you adjust a file in the `lib` or `spec` directories.

Backup 2 - Issues, Wiki, Source, Gems
=====================================

I won't actively support Backup 2 anymore. The source will remain on [a separate branch](https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/tree/backup-2). [The Issues](https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/issues) that belong to Backup 2 have been tagged with a black label "Backup 2". The Backup 2 specific [Wiki pages](https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/wiki) have been prefixed with "Backup 2) <Article>". [The Backup 2 Gems](http://rubygems.org/gems/backup) will always remain so you can still use Backup 2. I might still accept pull requests, but would highly encourage anyone to [move to __Backup 3__ once it's here](https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup).
