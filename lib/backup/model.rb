    # After all the database dumps and archives are placed inside

    # [Splitting]
    # Optionally splits the backup file in to multiple smaller chunks before transferring them
    ##
    # [Storages]
    # Runs all (if any) storage objects to store the backups to remote locations
    # and (if configured) it'll cycle the files on the remote location to limit the
    # amount of backups stored on each individual location

    # Runs all (if any) sync objects to store the backups to remote locations.
    # A Syncer does not go through the process of packaging, compressing, encrypting backups.

    # Runs all (if any) notifier objects when a backup proces finished with or without
    # any errors.
    ##
    # [Cleaning]
    # After the whole backup process finishes, it'll go ahead and remove any temporary
    # file that it produced. If an exception(error) is raised during this process which
    # breaks the process, it'll always ensure it removes the temporary files regardless
    # to avoid mass consumption of storage space on the machine
